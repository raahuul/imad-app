         The total value of demonetized currency, in the form of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 notes, was Rs. 15.44 lakh crores,
         of which Rs.15.28 lakh crores came back to the banking system, which is 98.96 percent. Since a few small windows are still open for the return of demonetized currency,
         the final figure will certainly exceed 99 percent, which puts paid to the governmentâ€™s claim that demonetization would deal a crippling blow to the black economy

        The absurdity of this argument now stands exposed.

        Well, it now turns out that that the value of currency not returned till now is only a paltry Rs.16000 crores,
        and most of it no doubt from honest people who could not meet the deadline for turning in their old currency notes: it amounts in other words to a sheer loot of honest people by the government.
