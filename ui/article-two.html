            In case you ever get stuck in a car in a flood like situation, here are some essential dos and don'ts.

            1. Do not stay in the car, with the windows rolled up, thinking you'll stay safe and dry just because you're parked.
            After a while, the oxygen level inside the car will start depleting which can be fatal.
            If D water on D roads is heading up to the level of your tyres, please abandon the car.
            Being on your 2 feet may be uncomfortable but safer


            2. Park your car and get out, in case the water level reaches the door. Once water gets into the car,
            it can short circuit the electrical parts and make the security system malfunction leading to you getting locked inside the car.


            3. In case your car is almost submerged and you don't know how deep the waters are,
            do not try to open the doors. It is very difficult to do it against water pressure, and even if you manage to open the door, water will rush into the vehicle making it sink.


            4. If you think the car is indeed going to sink, unbuckle the seat belt. If the windows refuse to open,
            you would need to break it, to get out. For situations like these, it's ideal to have a small hammer handy, but in case it's not there,
            the head rest can be pulled out and the pointed end used to break the glass. "You can use your elbow or your heels also, right in the centre of the door window,
            not the front windscreen, not the rear windscreen. The front windscreen is laminated, so even if you're able to break it you will not be able to go through," the expert advised.



            5. If you're forced to drive through a flooded area,
            make sure you keep the engine rev higher than usual and the car in first gear to ensure that water does not enter the exhaust.
